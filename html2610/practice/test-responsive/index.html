            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
                language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host
                environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
                connected to the objects of its environment to provide
                programmatic control over them.

                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as
                Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such
                as operators, control structures, and statements. Core
                JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
                supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
                (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application
                to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events
                such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with
                a database, provide continuity of information from one
                invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                manipulations on a server.</p>
